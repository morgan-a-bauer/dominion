# A Digital Version of Dominion

This is a version of the card game [Dominion](https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion/) that we are currently working on. At the moment our implementation is text-based, but
we are working on a GUI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This repository makes use of the `math` and `random` Python libraries. 

### Running the game

This project has been primarily an exercise for us. If you have the desire to play the game, please do so through official channels. To run our version of the game,
run the `main.py` file and follow the instructions provided in the shell.
